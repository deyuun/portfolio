          <h2>Online Learning Journey:</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Uplift Full-Stack Web Dev Bootcamp</h3>
          <p>I completed Uplift Code Camp’s Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, strengthening my practical skills through hands-on projects and mentorship. I learned to build full-stack web applications using technologies like React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Our capstone project, <strong>GeoMemoryMap</strong>, was a collaborative effort that brought everything together—from frontend design to backend deployment. Finishing this bootcamp gave me the confidence and experience to start building real-world applications.</p>
          <h3>CS50x</h3>
          <p>I took a leap of faith by leaving university to pursue a self-taught path. Through CS50, I’ve gained a much deeper understanding of computer science fundamentals than I ever had before. This course taught me solid coding practices, core theories, data structures and algorithms, database design, and how to approach problems algorithmically. It’s been a challenging but rewarding experience that shaped how I think as a developer. I’m still working for my final project to get the certification :D</p>

          <h3>Our Lady of Fatima University | Computer Science</h3>
          <p>Aug 2022 - Dec 2023<br>I transferred here during the peak of the pandemic to gain a broader perspective on what computer science is really about. I learned a lot about programming, using development tools, collaborating in software engineering teams, turning ideas into code, and handling social pressure</p>
          <h3>St. Louis College Valenzuela | Computer Science</h3>
          <p>Aug 2019 - Dec 2020<br>My time at St. Louis College Valenzuela was my first step into college life. I gained not only technical knowledge but also learned the value of meeting deadlines, managing expectations, and personal growth.</p>
